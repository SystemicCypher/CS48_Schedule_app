****HOW TO READ A CLASS RATINGS FILE****

Each line of a class ratings file has three pieces of data separated by commas.

*The Instructor*
is the exact name of the Instructor of the class found on UCSB Curriculum Search.
If the class Instructor is TBA, the Instructor is given a default value of ‘TBA’.
If the Instructor is given a default value of ‘TBA’, the Instructor’s Rating automatically receives a default value of ‘D’.

A note about formatting

I found it necessary to include the instructor’s name in the class ratings files because it will allow us to submit real-time updates to class ratings files.
For example, if an instructor’s rating fluctuates due to new ratings submitted to RateMyProfessors, we can simply adjust the instructor’s rating found in the professor_ratings.txt file.
Once we adjust the instructor’s rating in the professor_ratings.txt file, we can run a simple program that will rewrite the class ratings files to include updated instructor ratings.

By including the instructor’s name with each class in the class ratings files, we can identify how the existing rating was derived.
This allows us to reuse class ratings files throughout different quarters and years.
We only adjust ratings if an instructor has an updated RateMyProfessors rating, or if a completely new instructor teaches the class.
